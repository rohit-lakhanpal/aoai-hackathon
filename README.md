# AOAI Hackathon Repository

Welcome to the AOAI Hackathon repository! This repository aims to assist organizations in conducting internal hackathons to investigate the potential benefits that democratized AI (powered by Azure) offers to SaaS businesses. Included within this repository are two projects showcasing the functionalities of different Azure Cognitiv Services:

1. [Shared APIs](./src/shared-apis/) - An Express app that provides helper APIs to call Azure Speech Services.
